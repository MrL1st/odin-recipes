    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread - any is fine, but preferably <em>stale</em> white</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Butter - salted/unsalted, whatever</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp Vanilla extract, or fake vanilla</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Milk</li>
        <li>Maple syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, get a plate or tupperware or something, and mix in
            your eggs, milk, vanilla, and sugar.
        </li>
        <li>After mixing, take your bread, and coat each side for about
            5 seconds each, just enough so it's damp but not breaking apart.
        </li>
        <li>Set a frying pan to medium heat and add your butter. Let it 
            melt completely.
        </li>
        <li>Load up your buttered frying pan with your battered bread,
            and let them toast on each side for 5 minutes, or until golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>After they're done cooking, load up your plate and treat yourself
            to some maple syrup on top. Lovely.
        </li>
    </ol>
