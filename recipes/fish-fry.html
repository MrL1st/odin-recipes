    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is List's perfect fish fry recipe. If you don't like fish, then what
        exactly are you doing here? To be persuaded?
    </p>
    <p>If that's the case, then look no further than here. Heck, even I'm not that
        big a fan of seafood! Yet whenever anyone tries this, they say it's 
        <em>fuego.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>White fish - any will do, but my personal favorites are cod and halibut</li>
        <li>Panko - Japanese electrocuted bread crumbs!</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Flour, as much as one needs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Old Bay</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Lemon - for freshness</li>
        <li>Oil - preferably a canola, rapeseed, or vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Coat your fish in flour. Make sure you coat every surface, including all the cracks and crevices.</li>
        <li>Dip your floured fish into an egg wash until it's all wet.</li>
        <li>Coat your wetted floured fish in panko. Like the flour, get all the fish's nooks and crannies.</li>
        <li>Let your fish sit for a few minutes. This will give you enough time to heat your pan at medium, filled halfway with oil.</li>
        <li>Set your fish for 10-15 minutes on each side until golden brown. Be sure to cook it slowly, lest you deal with cleaning your stovetop
            and eating burnt fish later.
        </li>
        <li>After you're done cooking, set your fish on a wire rack or a plate with a paper towel to absorb excess fat, then let it cool down for
            a few more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Squeeze some lemon on those bad boys and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
