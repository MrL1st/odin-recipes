    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ah, the BLT. The perfect hangover sandwich. Although I have to say, I do consider
        this more to be a <em>tomato</em> sandwich than a <em>bacon</em> sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>Seriously, this sandwich is so easy to make that I've done it after recovering from nights
        of partying and drinking. It's probably the only reason to get out of bed some days!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bacon - any kind works, personally I like the thick cut</li>
        <li>Lettuce, preferably iceburg</li>
        <li>Tomato, and make sure you get a tasty one, not any of those flavorless steak ones</li>
        <li>White bread</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise - it goes on a BLT. Deal with it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry up your bacon. Cook until your desired crispiness, then let it sit on a wire rack 
            or paper towels. Be sure to leave your bacon grease on the pan. Trust me, 
            <em>it will be significant.</em></li>
        <li>While your bacon is cooking, slice your tomatoes into rounds, and either break
            off your lettuce, or, chop it up into thin slices.</li>
        <li>While your pan is still hot, fry up your bread on one side per slice. Cook until your
            desired crispiness.
        </li>
        <li>Spread a layer of mayonnaise on one of the untoasted bread sides.</li>
        <li>Stack your ingredients in any way you desire. Personally, I prefer
            <ul>
                <li>Bacon first</li>
                <li>Then tomato</li>
                <li>Then the lettuce</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
