    <h3>Fries with Ketchup and Mayo</h3>
    <p>This classic dish can be eaten as a side or a full meal. Best eaten hot
    with a sauce.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 lbs peeled russet potatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>0.5 cup water (or as needed)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice potatoes into fries and place them into a large bowl
            of cold water to prevent browning.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a saucepan or skillet to 175 C/350 F.</li>
        <li>While heating the oil, mix together the flour, salt, garlic
        salt, onion salt, and paprika. Gradually stir in water to
        make the mixture thick enough to be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
        <li>Drain the water from the fries and pat dry. Then, dip each
        fry into the batter one at a time.</li>
        <li>Carefully lower the fries into the hot oil in batches.
        Fry them until they're golden brown on each side, about 8-10
        minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain oil from the fries on a paper towel or on a metal
        rack. Serve hot and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
